        Social Distance. Lockdown. Flatten the Curve.<br>
        You've heard it all, but what does it really mean?<br>
        Why should you care?<br>
        This DIY story explains what these things are and how they are supposed to help us combat the Coronavirus.

            This simulation shows the effects of following hygiene recommendations.<br>
            <br>
            Better hygiene can limit the spread of the virus. Better hygiene includes:
            <ul>
              <li>Washing hands regularly</li>
              <li>Sneezing and coughing into the elbow</li>
              <li>No touching of the face</li>
              <li>Wearing fase masks</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Try out different levels of hygiene to see what changes.

            You may have noticed that better hygiene levels "flatten the curve" - this means that the number of infections increases more slowly.

            Good hygiene alone will not prevent the majority of a population from becoming infected though.
            A population that relies only on good hygiene may overload their health service.

            As more patients are hospitalised, the health service is put under greater strain.

            One of the most effective ways to flatten the curve is by self-quarantining - leaving the house only when necessary.
